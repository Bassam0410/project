            was a British battlecruiser and the largest warship in the Royal
            Navy, known as the "Pride of the Fleet." Commissioned in 1920, it
            was renowned for its power and speed but met a tragic end on May 24,
            1941, during a battle with the German battleship Bismarck in the
            Denmark Strait. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,418 of its
            crew, with only three survivors.
